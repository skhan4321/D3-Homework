        </p>
      
        <h6>Please compare the data by selecting the different axis options.</h6>
        
        <h3>Poverty vs. X</h3>
        <p>Comparing poverty levels to access to healthcare shows a positive trend. Those who have higher poverty rates have less access to healthcare. This can be expected as healthcare in America is not affordable and those with higher poverty rates most likely can ont afford healthcare. The percent of the population that is obese is comparable among most states, but there is a positive correlation between poverty and obesity rates. Fast food is inexpensive compared to wholesome foods which could be a cause between this correlation. Smoking is also comprable among most states. There does seem to be a slight correlation between these factors. 
          </p>
    
        <h3>Age vs. X</h3>
        <p>Comparing age to access to healthcare does not show a strong correlation between the two. The data for the states are quite comparable. The most likely cause between who has healthcare is income rather than age, but without more data it's difficult to make these assumptions. There also isn't much correlation between age and obesity levels either. There is however, a positive correlation between age and smokers, showing that the older a population is the higher the percentage of smokers.
        </p>

        <h3>Income vs. X</h3>
        <p>Income does have an impact on healthcare. We can see that the higher the income, more of the population has healthcare. Income also has a strong impact on obesity. The higher the household income, the lower the obesity rates. The same can be said for smoking rates, which shoes the higher the income the lower the precentage of smokers.
